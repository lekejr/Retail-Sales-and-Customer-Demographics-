## Introduction
Retail businesses generate massive amounts of transactional data. Understanding who buys what and when, is essential for making data-driven decisions on product stocking, pricing and personalized marketing. 
This project explores customer demographics, purchase behavior and product trends using Microsoft Excel. Excel’s pivot tables, charts and data modeling features were used to clean, analyze and visualize the data in an interactive dashboard format.

##  Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze retail sales data and uncover patterns in customer behavior based on:
- Product category (Beauty, Clothing, Electronics)
- Age group (Child, Young Adult, Adult, Senior)
- Gender
- Time-based trends (2023 vs. 2024)
The insights derived from this analysis can help optimize pricing strategies, inventory decisions, and targeted marketing efforts.

## Tool Used 
Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, analysis, pivot tables and dashboard visualization.


## Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project includes transactional records from a retail store, capturing:

- `Product Category` (Beauty, Clothing, Electronics)  
- `Quantity Sold`  
- `Price per Unit`  
- `Customer Age Group`  
- `Customer Gender`  
- `Total Amount Spent`  
- `Purchase Year`
The dataset includes entries across two years (2023 and 2024) and records customer purchases across age and gender segments.


## Methodology
All analysis, data modeling and visualization were done using **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging the following features:
- Data cleaning using filters and conditional formatting
- Pivot tables for aggregation and multidimensional analysis
- Pivot charts (bar, line, pie) for visual storytelling
- Slicers to enable interactive filtering by Age Group and Product Category
- Custom formatting for a polished dashboard appearance


## Research Questions
The analysis was designed to answer the following key questions:
- Which product categories perform best in terms of quantity sold and revenue?
- How do customer age and gender influence spending behavior?
- Are there any noticeable trends or shifts in product sales across 2023 and 2024?
- Which age groups are the biggest spenders across product categories?
- What is the relationship between pricing and product category?


##  Processes

### Data Preparation in Excel
- Cleaned raw data: removed blanks, standardized category names  
- Created calculated columns: e.g., `Total Amount = Quantity × Price per Unit`  
- Structured data into tabular format for pivot table compatibility

### Dashboard Development in Excel
- Created **Pivot Tables** to summarize data by:
  - Product category
  - Age group and gender
  - Year-over-year sales

- Created **Pivot Charts**:
  - Pie chart: Quantity sold per category  
  - Line chart: Sales pattern by year  
  - Bar charts: Age & gender distribution, spending breakdowns, pricing comparison  
- Added **Slicers** for filtering by Age Group and Product Category  
- Used Excel formatting tools for clear layout, color consistency, and emphasis


## Insights

### Product Performance
- **Electronics** leads in total revenue, followed closely by **Clothing**, while **Beauty** has lower overall value but steady quantity sold.

### Time-Based Trends
- Sales for **Beauty** and **Electronics** dropped in 2024, while **Clothing** remained relatively stable or improved.

### Demographic Behavior
- **Adult** customers are the top spenders across both genders.
- **Females** spend more on **Beauty and Clothing**, while **Males** show more balanced spending across categories.
- **Seniors and Adults** dominate spending in high value categories like Electronics.

### Pricing Analysis
- **Electronics** have the highest average unit price, followed by **Clothing**, with **Beauty** being the most affordable.



## Key Findings

- **Adults** represent the most profitable age group for all categories.
- **Females** are more active in the Beauty and Clothing segments, while **Males** show more even distribution.
- **2024** saw a dip in **Beauty** and **Electronics** sales, indicating potential market saturation or external economic factors.
- **Product pricing** aligns with perceived category value — electronics command higher prices with lower quantity but higher total revenue.
- **Clothing** remains the most consistent category across all segments and years.


##  Conclusion
This analysis highlights the value of retail sales data in uncovering customer behavior trends. By analyzing sales through the lenses of age, gender, product type and time, businesses can refine their strategies to target the right audience with the right product at the right time.
The Excel dashboard offers a simple yet powerful way to derive insights from structured data. Future analysis could include promotions, discounts or seasonal effects to deepen understanding of purchasing patterns.
